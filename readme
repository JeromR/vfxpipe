This is the template for a basic VFX pipeline.
Current support is limited to Maya 2013/VRay (daily build as of May 03 2012) and Nuke.

In order to use the pipeline you will need to set some environment variables :

The Windows syntax is used here but if you're on Linux or OSX you can sort this out.
You can create a batch file with the following entries:
echo -----------------------------------------------------------
REM - this is the location of the root of the vfxpipe folder
set FXPIPEPATH=z:\software\devl_vfxpipe

REM - don't change the following 3 lines
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%FXPIPEPATH%\python;%FXPIPEPATH%\maya
set NUKE_PATH=%NUKE_PATH%;%FXPIPEPATH%\nuke
set MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH=%FXPIPEPATH%\maya

REM - these are optional here
set job=myjob
set seq=sequencename
set shot=0001
REM - end of optional variables

"c:\program files\autodesk\maya2012\bin\maya.exe"


Additionally, the pipeline listens to (and wants!) other variables:
set job=yourjobname
set seq=sequencename
set shot=shotnumber

These variables will allow the system to automatically load Nuke and Maya tools for the show.

OSX Variable information here:
export FXPIPEPATH=/Users/robn/vfxpipe 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$FXPIPEPATH/python:$FXPIPEPATH/maya
export NUKE_PATH=$NUKE_PATH:$FXPIPEPATH/nuke
export MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH=$FXPIPEPATH/maya

look in the fxpipe/__init__.py file for the information you need to modify for your custom setup
