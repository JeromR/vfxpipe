This is the template for a basic VFX pipeline.
Current support is limited to Maya/VRay and Nuke.

In order to use the pipeline you will need to set some environment variables :

The Windows syntax is used here but if you're on Linux or OSX you can sort this out.
set FXPIPEPATH=z:\software\devl_vfxpipe
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%FXPIPEPATH%\python;%FXPIPEPATH%\maya
set NUKE_PATH=%NUKE_PATH%;%FXPIPEPATH%\nuke

Additionally, the pipeline listens to (and wants!) other variables:
set job=yourjobname
set seq=sequencename
set shot=shotnumber

These variables will allow the system to automatically load Nuke and Maya tools for the show.

look in the fxpipe/__init__.py file for the information you need to modify for your custom setup
